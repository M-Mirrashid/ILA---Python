# ILA---Python
IbI Logic Optimization Algorithm: ILA

This repository contains Python code implementing an optimization algorithm, IbI Logic Optimization Algorithm (ILA). The ILA is an optimization algorithm that is based on the theory of IbI logics. The ILA has several advantages over other optimization algorithms. Here are some of the benefits of using the ILA optimization algorithm:

    The ILA can monitor the exploration and exploitation phases separately, which allows the user to control the performance of the algorithm and to adjust the parameters as needed.
    The ILA is very accurate in determining the optimal solution.
    The ILA has a reasonable computation time.
      

Structure:

    Main File: The primary script that executes the optimization algorithm. It calls the Cost_Function and ILA modules.
    Cost_Function: Defines the cost function to be minimized during the optimization process. This file includes detailed documentation of the cost function, its parameters, and any relevant assumptions.
    ILA: The core of the optimization algorithm, implementing the search strategy inspired by the ILA algorithm. This module is called by the Main File.

Definition of the considered cost function:

    Name: Easom
    Best Cost: -1
    Best Solution: (pi,pi)
    Dimension: 2
